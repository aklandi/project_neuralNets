# A Project in Neural Networks

I did not understand neural networks, so I decided I would learn about them.  The python code in this repository covers several cases of multi-layer neural networks (NN_case_by_case.py) and provides a generalized multi-layer neural network architecture (my_NN.py).  There are many neural network programs, e.g. Python has its own function in scikit learn.  I hope my implementation will at least help others understand how the fancier technology works.

I highly recommend neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com for a resource if you attempting to understand neural nets yourself.  This source also goes into deep learning, an extension of neural networks.
